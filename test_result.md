Vehicle AB-12-CD (3 days, €250/week) + EF-34-GH (4 days, €300/week). Expected calculation: (€250/7)×3 + (€300/7)×4 = €107.14 + €171.43 = €278.57. RESULTS: 1) aluguer_proporcional = true (vehicle switch detected), 2) valor_aluguer = €278.57 (exact match), 3) aluguer_detalhes shows 2 vehicles with correct days (7 total), 4) Report saved with proportional details correctly.
